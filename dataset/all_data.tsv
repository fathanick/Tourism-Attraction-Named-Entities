Actually	O
,	O
the	O
word	O
monolith	O
comes	O
from	O
the	O
Greek	O
word	O
“	O
monolithos	O
”	O
,	O
derived	O
from	O
mono	O
(	O
“	O
one	O

or	O
“	O
single	O
”	O
)	O
and	O
lithos	O
(	O
“	O
stone	O
”	O
)	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
context	O
of	O
this	O
top	O
10	O
list	O
it	O
refers	O
to	O
a	O
geological	O
feature	O
such	O
as	O
a	O
mountain	O
,	O
consisting	O
of	O
a	O
single	O
massive	O
stone	O
or	O
rock	O
.	O

A	O
problem	O
with	O
finding	O
the	O
largest	O
monolith	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
term	O
“	O
monolith	O
”	O
is	O
somewhat	O
ambiguous	O
.	O

Geologists	O
therefore	O
often	O
prefer	O
the	O
terms	O
monadnock	O
or	O
inselberg	O
(	O
literally	O
“	O
island	O
mountain	O
”	O
)	O
to	O
describe	O
an	O
isolated	O
hill	O
or	O
a	O
lone	O
mountain	O
that	O
rises	O
above	O
the	O
surrounding	O
area	O

Most	O
monoliths	O
in	O
this	O
top	O
10	O
are	O
inselbergs	O
,	O
although	O
not	O
every	O
inselberg	O
is	O
a	O
monolith	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
Mount	B-NATURAL
Augustus	I-NATURAL
in	O
western	O
Australia	O
is	O
often	O
called	O
a	O
monolith	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
actually	O
a	O
monocline	O
,	O
an	O
exposed	O
piece	O
of	O
rock	O
belonging	O
to	O
a	O
layer	O
beneath	O
.	O

In	O
other	O
words	O
a	O
monocline	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
single	O
piece	O
of	O
rock	O
although	O
the	O
distinction	O
isn	O
’	O
t	O
always	O
clear	O
.	O

Another	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
many	O
rocks	O
and	O
mountains	O
are	O
called	O
the	O
largest	O
monolith	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
but	O
these	O
claims	O
are	O
rarely	O
backed	O
up	O
by	O
geological	O
information	O
and	O
may	O
be	O
based	O
upon	O
a	O
single	O
dimension	O
such	O
as	O
